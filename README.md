Shaku is a family of tools to help write technical blogs,
out of my frustration while writing articles for my personal blog - [jser.dev](https://jser.dev).

## Tools

1. [shaku-code-annotate](./packages/shaku-code-annotate/) - plugins to annotate code snippets in markdown.
2. [Shaku Playground](https://shaku-web.vercel.app/) - a playground to try out shaku-code-annotate.
3. [Shaku Snippet](https://shaku-web.vercel.app/snippet) - generate beautiful code snippet screenshots with annotation.

## Dev Tools

Also with some dev tools if you are interested

1. [Shiki Token Inspector](https://shaku-web.vercel.app/shiki-token-inspector) - easily inspect the tokens generated by [shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki), shaku works based on these tokens.

## Community

1. [Shaku Discord](https://discord.gg/bFh8EzW7kv)
